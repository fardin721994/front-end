00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.760
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:00:04.969 --> 00:00:07.137
Come on.
You're going out with a guy.

3
00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:09.848
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

4
00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:11.933
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

5
00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:15.771
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

6
00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:20.233
I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl. Oh.

7
00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:23.236
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

8
00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:26.406
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

9
00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:28.158
Sounds like a date to me.

10
00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:33.872
I'm back in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria...

11
00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:37.417
...and I realize I'm totally naked.

12
00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:39.169
- Oh, yeah.
- I've had that dream.

13
00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:43.465
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

14
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.009
...there.

15
00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:48.845
- Instead of...
- That's right!

16
00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:50.555
MONICA: That one, I've never had.
PHOEBE: No.

17
00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:54.851
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

18
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:56.812
And it turns out it's my mother.

19
00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:02.859
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

20
00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:09.783
Hi.

21
00:01:10.785 --> 00:01:13.954
This guy says "hello,"
I wanna kill myself.

22
00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:15.413
Are you okay, sweetie?

23
00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:20.335
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...

24
00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:23.380
...and tied it around my neck.
- Cookie?

25
00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:26.883
Carol moved her stuff out today.

26
00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:28.135
PHOEBE & JOEY:
Oh.

27
00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:30.095
- Let me get you some coffee.
- Thanks.

28
00:01:33.057 --> 00:01:34.808
Ew. Unh.

29
00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:38.937
No. No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

30
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.773
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

31
00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:46.653
I'll be fine. All right? Really.
I hope she'll be very happy.

32
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:48.155
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

33
00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:50.157
To hell with her. She left me!

34
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.160
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

35
00:01:57.206 --> 00:01:59.374
No! Okay?

36
00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:02.335
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

37
00:02:03.963 --> 00:02:06.756
She didn't know. How should I know?

38
00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:11.261
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

39
00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.890
Did I say that out loud?

40
00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:20.896
All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

41
00:02:21.063 --> 00:02:23.481
You're angry. You're hurting.

42
00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:25.942
Can I tell you what the answer is?

43
00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:27.444
Strip joints!

44
00:02:29.614 --> 00:02:31.948
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

45
00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:34.451
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

46
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.829
I just wanna be married again.

47
00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.086
And I just want a million dollars!

48
00:02:46.214 --> 00:02:47.297
Rachel?

49
00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:50.175
Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!

50
00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:53.511
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

51
00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:55.889
...that you might be here, and you are.

52
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.643
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Decaf.
